# Overview

Due to the ever changing world of software I thought it important to branch out and test myself in more than just 1 language. I decided to write this dip my toes into Java development by making a simple program that could write to a .txt file. I modeled after asking the user what Game they wanted recorded, what platform they could play it on, and to give their rating. The purpose was to help myself keep track of my growing library of videogames while also creating a program that could be reworded to easily do something like keep inventory. The main purpose of this code is to give me a brief glimpse into the world of Java programming.

# Development Environment

My IDE of choice is Visual Studio Code and the only JDK I could get the program to recognize was the JDK from Oracle themselves. Here are some links to help you download these tools should you want a similar enviornment.
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[Oracle's JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) 
Note: make sure you install the JDK for the right system you are using.

The language in use is Java and the libraries I imported were java.io and java.util to enable the use of reading and writing to terminal and files.

# Useful Websites

These are some useful sites I frequented, note that googling issues is very helpful if you have an idea of the problem at hand i.e. I know I want to open a file so google "How to open files in Java".

# Future Work

Here is a list of ways I hope to improve the program as time goes by
* Make it write to a csv file for easier reading and writing
* Add the ability to edit or remove lines within the file
* Allow for the user to fully view the file
* Allow basic sorting such as: display all games I've rated a 10
* Error handling! Don't input a letter when it asks for a number.
