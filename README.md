# Sprint1-Java
I worked on creating a java application particularly focusing on creating, opening, and using a file to store basic information from the user
# Video link
[Example](asdf.com)
## Additional Notes
These are just some ideas I hope to improve on with the idea given time
- Change file saving format to a csv for easier read and write
- Add an ability to display the file contents
- Edit and remove file contents through the application

While this app is extrememly bare bones it gave a good deal of insight into coding in Java vs. my comfort language Python

## Interesting tidbits I learned
- This language is VERY VERBOSE, Python types half as many keywords as Java.
- IO Streams! You have to be careful about how you close these, one wrong step and you've closed all user input off.
- Install your JDK (Java Development Kit) straight from Oracle, I downloaded half a dozen and Visual Studio Code only found the one I used from Oracle. Just save yourself some time if your computer gets finicky like mine was.
